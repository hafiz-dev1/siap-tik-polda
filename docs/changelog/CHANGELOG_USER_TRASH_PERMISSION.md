```

```diff
+ Added userRole prop
+ Added canManageUsers check
+ Show "Hanya Super Admin" message for non-SUPER_ADMIN
+ Hide action buttons for pengguna entity if not SUPER_ADMIN
```

### 4. `src/app/components/BulkTrashActionsToolbar.tsx`
```diff

+ Hide toolbar completely for non-SUPER_ADMIN when entityType='pengguna'
```

### 5. `src/app/components/TrashUsersWithPagination.tsx`
